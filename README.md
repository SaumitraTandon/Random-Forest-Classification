# Random Forest Classification

## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook titled `random_forest_classification.ipynb`, which implements a random forest classification algorithm. Random forests are an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve classification accuracy and control overfitting.

## Contents

- **random_forest_classification.ipynb**: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation of the random forest classification algorithm, along with explanations, visualizations, and results.

## Requirements

To run the notebook, ensure you have the following packages installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**: 
   Change into the directory where the notebook is located:

   ```bash
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**: 
   Start Jupyter Notebook in your terminal:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. **Open the Notebook**: 
   In your web browser, navigate to the `random_forest_classification.ipynb` file and open it.

5. **Run the Notebook**: 
   Execute the cells in the notebook to see the random forest classification in action.

## Usage

The notebook includes the following sections:

- **Data Import**: Load the dataset required for classification.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the data for modeling.
- **Model Training**: Train the random forest classifier on the training dataset.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
- **Visualization**: Visualize the results and feature importance.
